# My-Simulations-in-CST
I'll put my Antenna designs with CST here. doing Antenna for now, hope it will be more than that! 

## Intro
I'm planning to ipload my simulations here, because it just makes me feel good about what I'm doing! 
some of the simulations can be wrong, but I've done my best to avoid that. most of the simulations are done by sources.
the main source for Antenna simulations was "CST fundamentals" by davood zarifi from kashak university.
